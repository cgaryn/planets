It's cold and dry, folks.  Very, very red.  Really ROUND.  We hate to see it, folks!  
It has only two moons.  JUST TWO!  My planets only have many moons, the most moons.  Sad!
But the red is nice, real nice.  Like my beautiful ties.  Very bold, powerful.  
It's the color of fire trucks, folks.  Honk honk!  Vroom vroom!  Big beautiful trucks.
